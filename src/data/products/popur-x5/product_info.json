  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Does it work with my cat's litter brand?",
      "answer": "Yes—X5 works with any clumping clay litter (bentonite). Avoid non-clumping, crystal, or pellet litters."
    },
    {
      "question": "My cat is huge (25+ lbs). Will it fit?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. The 24-inch open-top tray fits cats up to 33 lbs, including Maine Coons, Ragdolls, and Norwegian Forest Cats."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often do I change the waste bin?",
      "answer": "For 1-3 cats, once every 30 days. For 4-6 cats, weekly. For 7-12 cats, every 3-4 days with frequent bag swaps."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it safe? Can my cat get stuck during cleaning?",
      "answer": "100% safe. The open-top design has zero pinch points, and sensors pause the cycle if a cat enters mid-clean."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it require special bags or expensive refills?",
      "answer": "No proprietary bags—use any 13-gallon trash bag. Cardboard bins are recyclable; plastic bins are reusable forever."
    },
    {
      "question": "How loud is the cleaning cycle?",
      "answer": "Whisper-quiet—quieter than a dishwasher. It won't wake you at night or startle nervous cats."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if it breaks? Is support included?",
      "answer": "Lifetime support is included—firmware updates, troubleshooting, and replacement parts shipped fast, no extra cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I return it if my cats refuse to use it?",
      "answer": "Yes—30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. Most cats adjust within 2-3 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it need an app or WiFi to work?",
      "answer": "No—X5 runs fully automatic without an app. Optional app features may be available for scheduling, but core function is standalone."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does setup take?",
      "answer": "10 minutes. Unbox, plug in, add litter, attach waste bin. Quick-start guide walks you through step-by-step."
